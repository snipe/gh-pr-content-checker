# GitHub PR Content Checker

This action checks for the presence or absence of a word in the body or diff in a PR, as well as the number of lines and files changed. It fails if one or more of the set criteria isn't met.

# Using this action

You need to add this in a file in `.github/workflows` and set appropriate options.

```
name: "Check PR content"
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  check_pr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Check PR
      uses: jsoares/gh-pr-content-checker@master
      with:
        github-token: ${{github.token}}
        bodyContains: 'Add this'
        bodyDoesNotContain: "Delete this"        
        diffContains: 'Add this'
        diffDoesNotContain: "Delete this"        
        maxLinesChanged: 1
        maxFilesChanged: 1
```

An example is also provided in .github/workflows/ in this repository.
